      <description>Are you looking to break into the tech industry? Get out of that mindless software contracting job? This guide is for you!
There are three pillars that I based my preparation for job interviews on recently that lead to multiple job offers&amp;ndash;including one that doubled my base salary. I believe that working through these three pillars will make you a strong enough candidate to &amp;lsquo;upgrade&amp;rsquo; your career one level. What I mean by this is that you can jump one level&amp;ndash;such as being outside of the industry to getting your first development job.</description>

      <title>Using API Gateway with Content Type other than JSON</title>

      <description>Amazon Web Services&amp;rsquo; API Gateway and Lambda are perfect for capturing webhooks. The only problem is when the webhook being captured uses something other than application/json as the content-type. Webhooks, or any type of request passing a payload, cannot deliver their data without some changes to your API Gateway.
Let&amp;rsquo;s create a API Gateway endpoint that takes application/x-www-form-urlencoded and returns the same data formatted in application/json. The easiest way to do this is set up a lambda function as our backend that consumes and processes our raw data.</description>
